* I'm a designer working in government, currently at NHS. 
* As well as being a desiger, I make art (currently I focus on painting). 
* I live in south east London. I love it here. And I love London.
* I'm interested in cities, especially how they can make neighbourhoods more friendly for humans, nature, and active travel.
* I'm involved in a local community gardening project, where we're looking after some planters outside a Co-op. 
* I'm interested in positive visions for the future.
