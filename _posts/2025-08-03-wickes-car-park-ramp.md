Since I moved back to London, I've been looking for cycling routes that are near or along water. I quickly found the <a href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/find-a-route-on-the-national-cycle-network/waterlink-way/">Waterlink Way</a> â€“ a pedestrian and cycling path that goes all the way from Cutty Sark to South Norwood. 

I miss Brighton's <a href="https://undercliffwalk.uk/">Undercliff walk</a>, but cycling along Ravensbourne river is still quite good. I am lucky to have nature all around me: I'm near Greenwich Park and Beckenham Place Park (the Hampstead Heath of South London).

## The ramp in the Wickes car park
So on the way to the Waterlink Way there is a little ramp in a car park, which clearly wasn't put there by Lewisham Council:

It's a mystery who put this little ramp there. It probably didn't cost very much, but for those who discover it[^1], it probably seriously improves the experience for cyclists who travel through here. 

Thank god for the Wickes car park ramp!  

And thank god for people who just do things which improve city infrastructure without asking for permission.

(Writing about the Wickes car park ramp is inspired by Hazel Perryman who shared a tribute to the ramp on Instagram.)

[^1]: It's not very visible when you approach it, but few cyclists would probably choose to plunge over a kerb
