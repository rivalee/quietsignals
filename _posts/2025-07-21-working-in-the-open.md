I joined NHS screening (breast cancer) in May, and I've gradually been getting up to speed.

Last week I wrote a design history post for my NHS project on screening: <a href="https://design-history.prevention-services.nhs.uk/manage-breast-screening/2025/07/medical-annotation-tool-for-capturing-breast-features/" target="_new">Designing a medical annotation tool for capturing breast features</a>.

As this is a medical annotation tool, it's an unusual thing to encounter in interaction design. It's probably most similar to a map in a service, where you could add landmarks to a map. A highlight was working with the clinician who drew the excellent annotations featured in the post. 

This is the first design history I've written, as GDS doesn't happen to have this trend. In the past, designers at GDS tended to blog on <a href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/">Design Notes</a>. But blogging has become increasingly slow as blog posts go through various checks. I would like to suggest that GDS designers now start using design histories to work in the open.
