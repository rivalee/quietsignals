Welcome to my new Twitter. 

The intention is to share some low-pressure bits and pieces about design, share some thoughts, share some things I have done or am in the process of doing.

I'm currently a freelance designer working in government. I work on a digital NHS proiect. 

I live in south east London. I also paint and make comics.

I'm interested in how cities can make neighbourhoods more friendly for humans, nature, and active travel.

I'm involved in a local community gardening project, where we're looking after some planters outside a Co-op. 

I'm interested in utopias and positive visions for the future.
