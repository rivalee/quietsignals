I joined NHS screening (breast cancer) in May. It's a massive honour to be working on a digital public health project, and I take this work seriously. 

Last week I wrote a design history post: <a href="https://design-history.prevention-services.nhs.uk/manage-breast-screening/2025/07/medical-annotation-tool-for-capturing-breast-features/" target="_new">Designing a medical annotation tool for capturing breast features</a>. 

A medical annotation tool is an unusual thing to encounter in interaction design. Itâ€™s probably most similar to a map in a service.

A highlight of this project is working alongside subject matter experts, including the distinguished doctor who created the medical drawings featured in the post.

This is the first design history I've written, which is a great way to directly share work in progress without the pressures of an official organisation blog.
