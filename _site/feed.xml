<p>The intention is to share some low-pressure bits and pieces about design, share some thoughts, share some things I have done or am in the process of doing.</p>

<p>I’m currently a freelance designer working in government. I work on a digital NHS proiect.</p>

<p>I live in south east London. I’m interested in how cities can make neighbourhoods more friendly for humans, nature, and active travel.</p>

<p>I’m also interested in utopias and positive visions for the future.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to my new Twitter.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Working in the open</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/07/21/working-in-the-open.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Working in the open" /><published>2025-07-21T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-07-21T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/07/21/working-in-the-open</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/07/21/working-in-the-open.html"><![CDATA[<p>I joined NHS screening (breast cancer) in May, and I’ve gradually been getting up to speed.</p>

<p>Last week I wrote a design history post for my NHS project on screening: <a href="https://design-history.prevention-services.nhs.uk/manage-breast-screening/2025/07/medical-annotation-tool-for-capturing-breast-features/" target="_new">Designing a medical annotation tool for capturing breast features</a>.</p>

<p>As this is a medical annotation tool, it’s an unusual thing to encounter in interaction design. It’s probably most similar to a map in a service, where you could add landmarks to a map. A highlight was working with the clinician who drew the excellent annotations featured in the post.</p>

<p>This is the first design history I’ve written, as GDS doesn’t happen to have this trend. In the past, designers at GDS tended to blog on <a href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/">Design Notes</a>. But blogging has become increasingly slow as blog posts go through various checks. I would like to suggest that GDS designers now start using design histories to work in the open.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I joined NHS screening (breast cancer) in May, and I’ve gradually been getting up to speed.]]></summary></entry></feed>
