I quickly found the <a href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/find-a-route-on-the-national-cycle-network/waterlink-way/">Waterlink Way</a> – a pedestrian and cycling path that goes all the way from Cutty Sark to South Norwood.</p>

<p>I miss Brighton’s <a href="https://undercliffwalk.uk/">Undercliff walk</a>, but cycling along Ravensbourne river is still quite good. I am lucky to have nature all around me: I’m near Greenwich Park and Beckenham Place Park (the Hampstead Heath of South London).</p>

<h2 id="the-ramp-in-the-wickes-car-park">The ramp in the Wickes car park</h2>
<p>So on the way to the Waterlink Way there is a little ramp in a car park, which clearly wasn’t put there by Lewisham Council:</p>

<p><img alt="Small concrete ramp on a kerb" src="/assets/images/catford-ramp.png" /></p>

<p>It’s a mystery who put this little ramp there. It probably didn’t cost very much, but for those who discover it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, it probably seriously improves the experience for cyclists who travel through here.</p>

<p>Thank god for the Wickes car park ramp!</p>

<p>And thank god for people who just do things which improve city infrastructure without asking for permission.</p>

<p>(Writing about the Wickes car park ramp is inspired by Hazel Perryman who shared a tribute to the ramp on Instagram.)</p>

      <p>It’s not very visible when you approach it, but few cyclists would probably choose to plunge over a kerb <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

It’s a massive honour to be working on a digital public health project, and I take this work seriously.</p>

<p>Last week I wrote a design history post: <a href="https://design-history.prevention-services.nhs.uk/manage-breast-screening/2025/07/medical-annotation-tool-for-capturing-breast-features/" target="_new">Designing a medical annotation tool for capturing breast features</a>.</p>

<p>A medical annotation tool is an unusual thing to encounter in interaction design. It’s probably most similar to a map in a service.</p>

<p>A highlight of this project is working alongside subject matter experts, including the distinguished doctor who created the medical drawings featured in the post.</p>

<p>This is the first design history I’ve written, which is a great way to directly share work in progress without the pressures of an official organisation blog.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I joined NHS screening (breast cancer) in May.
